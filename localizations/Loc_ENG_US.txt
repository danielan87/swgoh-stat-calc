BARRISS_BUNDLE_BUYER_BENEVOLENCE_BULLETIN|Thank you for playing Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes! We recently made some balance changes to Barriss Offee which may have affected the way that you used her in your squad compositions. Because of this, we have decided to award 500 crystals to players who purchased the Heroine Bundle Pack.
BARRISS_OFFEE_UPDATE_MESSAGE|Our team has identified an issue with Barriss Offee in which allies were still recovering 20% Max Health whenever they were critically hit even after Barriss was no longer present in the battle. This has been flagged as a bug as her Zeta ability was not meant to persist after death. Today, we will be removing the Zeta upgrade and granting them back to each respective player via inbox message in order to allow them the ability to choose whether or not they want to invest in this character again. We apologize for any inconvenience!

Virtual Currency and other In-Game Content\n\nEA may offer virtual or fictional points, coins, or currencies ("EA Virtual Currency") in the Beta Program. When you obtain this EA Virtual Currency, you receive a limited, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable license to access and select from in-game products, services, assets, or content ("EA In-Game Content") that EA expressly makes available in the Beta Program. The EA User Agreement contains additional terms that apply to your access and use of EA Virtual Currency and EA In-Game Content.\n\nThe Beta Program and Beta Materials will run in a test environment, and characters, achievements, progress, features, EA Virtual Currency and EA In-Game Content that you obtain while participating in the Beta Program may be erased, updated or modified at EA's sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you.

Sections 1-9 of this Agreement survive termination of this Agreement.\n\n6. Relief and Indemnity\n\nYou agree that a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement will cause EA irreparable injury, that money damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that EA shall be entitled to ex parte injunctive relief without bond to stop a breach or threatened breach.\n\n7.

CantinaChar_Challenges_FirstUnlock007|And finally, [f0ff23]CREDITS[-]. You can use those all over the place!
CantinaChar_Challenges_FirstUnlock008|As it is in war, defeating a Challenge isn't always about using the strongest squad. It's about choosing the right squad for the job.
CantinaChar_Challenges_FirstUnlock009|Pay attention to the rules for a given Challenge. They can dramatically affect what happens in battle.
CantinaChar_Challenges_FirstUnlock010|Tap a Challenge panel to see the rules of engagement.
CantinaChar_Challenges_FirstUnlock011|I'll start you off with some simple battles. But later on, I won't go so easy on you. Good luck.

CantinaChar_FleetWar_CompleteFirstWar001|You... did it... I can hardly believe this.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_CompleteFirstWar002|I... have a confession.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_CompleteFirstWar003|I have never actually won the whole war myself.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_CompleteFirstWar004|Tell me. Tell me how you did it! I must know.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock001|Hmmm... Maybe you are ready now. But I doubt it. Let us see how you do.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock002|This is the [f0ff23]GALACTIC WAR[-] table. You can attempt to defeat this table only [f0ff23]ONCE PER DAY[-]--make it count!
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock003|You will play a series of battles against other players' squads.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock004|It will start easy and get harder the further you progress on the battlefield.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock005|Important! The health of each character carries over from battle to battle. Keep this in mind!
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock006|Also! Any units that are defeated during a Galactic War cannot be used on this table for the rest of the day.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock007|Defeated units can, of course, be used on other tables. Just not here until your Galactic War resets.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock008|After each successful battle, you will be able to open a [f0ff23]SPECIAL REWARD CHEST[-]. Enjoy the spoils of war.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock009|The further you progress, the greater the rewards.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock010|Be sure to check the table's [f0ff23]GALACTIC WAR STORE[-] to redeem the [f0ff23]GALACTIC WAR TOKENS[-] you've earned.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock011|If you forget how the table works, tap the [f0ff23]DETAILS[-] button to learn more.

CantinaChar_FleetWar_Locked002|Ssssssss! Careful! You would not survive this war.\n\n(Reach [f0ff23]Player Level 40[-] to unlock this feature.)
CantinaChar_FleetWar_Locked003|You need a collection that is large, powerful, and strong to endure this war of attrition.\n\n(Reach [f0ff23]Player Level 40[-] to unlock this feature.)
CantinaChar_FleetWar_Locked004|The weak are not allowed here! Move along.\n\n(Reach [f0ff23]Player Level 40[-] to unlock this feature.)
CantinaChar_FleetWar_SeasonedVet001|Oh, it's you. Please show me how you play. I need to learn!
CantinaChar_FleetWar_SeasonedVet002|So strong... so powerful. How do you do it?
CantinaChar_FleetWar_WarIncomplete001|Keep trying. Build a bigger collection. Make them more powerful. You might just be able to win the war... Maybe.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_WarIncomplete002|Come prove your strength and worth. Can you do it? Probably not! HA!

CantinaChar_SimTickets_FirstUnlock002|These will help you on your way to building the most powerful team around.

CantinaChar_SimTickets_FirstUnlock004|This is important when you're looking to win specific [f0ff23]GEAR[-] or [f0ff23]SHARDS[-].
CantinaChar_SimTickets_FirstUnlock005|Give them a try!
CantinaChar_SquadArena_FirstUnlock001|What? YOU unlocked this already? That doesn't make...

CantinaChar_SquadBattles_FirstUnlock005|If you're having trouble moving forward, try assembling a different party. You'll need to pay attention to which characters are strong against others.

CantinaChar_SquadBattles_FirstUnlock007|This is also a great place to win those [f0ff23]ABILITY MATERIALS[-] you need to power up your characters' combat abilities.

DAILY_GUILD_CONTRIBUTION_CHANGE_DESC|The Daily Activity “Personal Guild Contribution” has been removed and a new way to contribute Guild Bank Coins has been implemented! Track your personal contribution to your guild in the new Guild Activities section in the Guild area of the Cantina.\n\nDue to this change, we are going to grant some Guild Bank Coins to offset any loss of Coins accrued. In addition, we know that last week there was a server bug where Guilds completed a Raid with a single individual doing an extraordinary amount of damage. Due to this bug, we've decided to increase the amount of Guild Bank Coins your Guild will receive, from 15,000 to 75,000.\n\nAll Guilds will receive 75,000 Guild Bank Coins when the Guild Leader logs in.

NEWSLETTER_POWER_FORMULA_CHANGE_DESC|The Power rating has long been a prominent display of a unit's general effectiveness. Though this rating is intended to be a useful way to identify how strong a unit is, it has become less and less effective for this purpose over time. This is primarily due to the formula being based entirely on the raw base stats of the unit, which doesn't account for all upgrades such as abilities.\n\nIn the interest of making the Power formula more reliable as a reference point for a unit's effectiveness, we've modified the formula to recognize every upgrade made to a unit. This change will result in your units appearing to have a much higher power, however this will NOT have any impact on their performance in combat. The changes are purely intended to be a shorthand representation of a unit's general effectiveness.

RAID_TRIUMVIRATE_SUMMARY|Defeat the Ancient Sith Lords
RAID_TUTORIAL_FORTIFY_MSG_1|In this phase, some of your characters will be able to use [c][ffff33]Unbreakable Will[-][/c] to protect the team.
RAID_TUTORIAL_FORTIFY_MSG_2|After someone uses [c][ffff33]Unbreakable Will[-][/c], all enemies will target them for one turn, but they will survive ANY attack, no matter what - even Annihilate!
RAID_TUTORIAL_FORTIFY_MSG_3|Normally, [c][ffff33]Unbreakable Will[-][/c] can only be used once, but you can defeat [c][309AF5]Menacing[-][/c] minions to reuse it!
RAID_TUTORIAL_GRANTED_ABILITY_MSG_1|In the Sith Triumvirate Raid, there is no Escape Ability. Instead, there are new abilities you'll be using in each phase.
RAID_TUTORIAL_SOOTHE_MSG_1|In this phase, Sion will apply stacks of [c][ffff33]Cycle of Pain[-][/c] and [c][ffff33]Cycle of Suffering[-][/c] with his abilities. [c][ffff33]Cycle of Pain[-][/c] makes you stronger, but it also makes Sion stronger, so watch out!
RAID_TUTORIAL_SOOTHE_MSG_2|Your characters can use [c][ffff33]Soothe[-][/c] to remove Cycle of Pain and Cycle of Suffering from themselves.
RAID_TUTORIAL_SOOTHE_MSG_3|[c][ffff33]Pain[-][/c] makes Sion powerful, but it may also give you the strength you need to beat him... How much [c][ffff33]Pain[-][/c] can you endure?
RAID_TUTORIAL_STAND_ALONE_MSG_1|In this phase, Traya will use [c][ffff33]Bonds of Weakness[-][/c] to punish your characters for working together. 
RAID_TUTORIAL_STAND_ALONE_MSG_2|Every time a character takes an action adds a stack of [c][ffff33]Bonds of Weakness[-][/c]. [c][ffff33]Bonds of Weakness[-][/c] deals damage that increases with each stack.
RAID_TUTORIAL_STAND_ALONE_MSG_2_V2|Every time your characters use an ability, Traya gains one stack of [c][ffff33]Bonds of Weakness[-][/c]. [c][ffff33]Bonds of Weakness[-][/c] deals damage that increases with each stack.
RAID_TUTORIAL_STAND_ALONE_MSG_3|To counter [c][ffff33]Bonds of Weakness[-][/c], each character can use [c][ffff33]Stand Alone[-][/c]. This ability allows that character to face Darth Traya alone.
RAID_TUTORIAL_STAND_ALONE_MSG_4|When [c][ffff33]Stand Alone[-][/c] is used all other allies become Suppressed, but grant bonuses based on their role to the character that used Stand Alone. Suppression is removed after Stand Alone expires.

MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_01_ZETA|Let's look at the Zeta abilities of Darth Vader and Grand Admiral Thrawn.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_02_ZETA|Grand Admiral Thrawn's Unique ability, [c][F0FF23]EBB AND FLOW[-][/c], interacts with the [c][F0FF23]FRACTURE[-][/c] debuff.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_03_ZETA|If an Empire ally uses a Special ability while Thrawn is active, the foe that has the [c][F0FF23]FRACTURE[-][/c] debuff will lose Turn Meter.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_04_ZETA|Meanwhile, the Zeta level of Darth Vader's Leader ability, [c][F0FF23]INSPIRING THROUGH FEAR[-][/c], will reapply Damage Over Time for 2 turns whenever Damage Over Time expires on your enemies.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_05_ZETA|Continue the fight and observe the power behind Zeta abilities.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_06_ZETA|This works well with his Unique ability, [c][F0FF23]NO ESCAPE[-][/c], which recovers his Health when a Damage Over Time effect expires on an enemy. Additionally, he is also immune to Turn Meter Reduction.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T1_01|You're outnumbered in this fight. But don't worry.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T1_02|Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine can debuff the opposition and escalate their attacks to finish off an enemy. Let me show you.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T1_03|Use Emperor Palpatine's [c][F0FF23]POWER OF THE DARK SIDE[-][/c] to attack and Stun your enemies. You'll also grant Offense Up to Darth Vader.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T1_04|Now follow up with Darth Vader's [c][F0FF23]FORCE CRUSH[-][/c] to deal more AoE damage and apply debuffs.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T1_05|Use [c][F0FF23]LET THE HATE FLOW[-][/c] to give Health Steal Up to Darth Vader.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T1_06|Attack with [c][F0FF23]CULLING BLADE[-][/c] which will deal extra damage for each debuff it dispels.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T1_07|Even when outnumbered, you overwhelmed your enemies by using a combination of AoE attacks and debuffs, which lead to a huge strike.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T1_08|Continue to use Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine to crush your foes!
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T2_01|Grand Admiral Thrawn is a formidable ally that provides your team with a variety of combat and support abilities.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T2_02|Let's use [c][F0FF23]GRAND ADMIRAL'S COMMAND[-][/c] to exchange Turn Meter with TIE Fighter Pilot and clear both their debuffs. 
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T2_03|Use this opportunity to attack with [c][F0FF23]TIE STRIKE[-][/c] to deal AoE damage and debuff the enemy.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T2_04|[c][F0FF23]FRACTURE[-][/c] is a debuff that prevents an enemy from gaining buffs, bonus Attacks, bonus Turn Meter, and prevents them from taking turns for a short while.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T2_05|So let's attack with [c][F0FF23]FRACTURE[-][/c] and debuff the target enemy.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T2_06|Thanks to Grand Admiral Thrawn's Leader ability, [c][F0FF23]LEGENDARY STRATEGIST[-][/c], all allies can use [c][F0FF23]MANEUVER[-][/c].
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T2_07|[c][F0FF23]MANEUVER[-][/c] allows an ally to Dispel all their debuffs and gain Turn Meter.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T2_08|Using Grand Admiral Thrawn effectively will strengthen an Empire team with his array of powerful moves. 
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T2_09|Now go and finish the fight!
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T3_01|Let's see how well a full Empire squad works together against the Rebels.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T3_02|Use [c][F0FF23]GRAND ADMIRAL'S COMMAND[-][/c] to exchange Turn Meter with Emperor Palpatine.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T3_03|Attack with [c][F0FF23]POWER OF THE DARK SIDE[-][/c] to deal AoE damage and apply Stun to the enemy team. Your allies will also gain Offense Up.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T3_04|Strike with [c][F0FF23]FRACTURE[-][/c] to debuff Commander Luke Skywalker.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T3_05|Use [c][F0FF23]LET THE HATE FLOW[-][/c] to grant Health Steal Up to your party.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T3_06|Continue the assault with [c][F0FF23]FORCE CRUSH[-][/c] to deal more AoE damage and apply debuffs.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T3_07|Have Shoretrooper use [c][F0FF23]REGROUP[-][/c] to reapply Taunt and grant Critical Hit Immunity to your team. 
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T3_08|Finally, top it off with an AoE attack from [c][F0FF23]TIE STRIKE[-][/c].
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T3_09|By unifying the abilities of your Empire squad, you managed to overwhelm the Rebels.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_EMPIRE_T3_10|Now the rest is up to you. Good luck!
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_01_ZETA|Let's look over the Zeta abilities of units from the First Order.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_02_ZETA|First Order TIE Pilot has a chance to gain Foresight for 2 turns when he loses Advantage, thanks to the Unique ability, [c][F0FF23]KEEN EYE[-][/c].
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_03_ZETA|First Order Stormtrooper can call a random ally to assist and grants them Advantage for 2 turns if they were [c][F0FF23]FIRST ORDER[-][/c] because of the Unique ability [c][F0FF23]RETURN FIRE[-][/c].
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_04_ZETA|Finally, Kylo Ren's Special ability, [c][F0FF23]OUTRAGE[-][/c], recovers Protection equal to the damage he dealt.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_05_ZETA|Continue the fight and win the battle by utilizing the Zeta abilities of your First Order units.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_T1_01|[c][F0FF23]ADVANTAGE[-][/c] is a buff that guarantees a Critical Hit on your next attack. Let me show you how to use it.

MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_T1_03|Now select First Order TIE Pilot to gain 100% Turn Meter, Offense Up, and [c][F0FF23]ADVANTAGE[-][/c].
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_T1_04|First Order TIE Pilot now has [c][F0FF23]ADVANTAGE[-][/c].
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_T1_05|Use the Special ability, [c][F0FF23]GUN DOWN[-][/c], to attack an enemy!
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_T1_06|First Order TIE Pilot dealt a powerful strike and can inflict debuffs with [c][F0FF23]GUN DOWN[-][/c] by utilizing [c][F0FF23]ADVANTAGE[-][/c].
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_T1_07|Use Captain Phasma's [c][F0FF23]VICTORY MARCH[-][/c] to grant all your allies [c][F0FF23]ADVANTAGE[-][/c] and gain the upper hand in this fight.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_T2_01|I'll show you how to utilize First Order abilities to change the flow of battle.

MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_T2_05|The ebb and flow of battle is always in constant flux.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_T2_06|Granting Turn Meter to your allies with First Order Trooper and Kylo Ren is a great step towards achieving victory.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_T3_01|Thanks to Captain Phasma's Leader ability, [c][F0FF23]FIRE AT WILL[-][/c], all First Order Allies start the encounter with [c][F0FF23]ADVANTAGE[-][/c].
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_FIRSTORDER_T3_02|Start by using First Order Officer's Basic ability, [c][F0FF23]CAPITALIZE[-][/c], to utilize the guaranteed critical hit.

MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_RESISTANCE_01|Enemies suffering from the [c][F0FF23]EXPOSE[-][/c] debuff will take additional damage when they are attacked. Let me show you how to use it.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_RESISTANCE_01_T2|Let's utilize the buffs that BB-8, Finn and Poe can grant to your team. Then we'll strike and debuff your opponents.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_RESISTANCE_01_T3|Let's see what Zeta ability upgrades do for the Resistance faction.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_RESISTANCE_01_T4|Let's combine the abilities of your [c][F0FF23]RESISTANCE[-][/c] team to defeat the enemy.

MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_RESISTANCE_04_T2|Use [c][F0FF23]RESISTANCE BRAVADO[-][/c] to gain Taunt and apply [c][F0FF23]EXPOSE[-][/c] to your enemies.
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_RESISTANCE_04_T3|Finn's Leader ability Zeta allows Resistance allies to take turns sooner and use Special abilties more often when damaging enemies with [c][F0FF23]EXPOSE[-][/c].
MSG_EVENT_BASIC_TRAINING_RESISTANCE_04_T4|Use [c][F0FF23]RESISTANCE BRAVADO[-][/c] to gain Taunt and apply [c][F0FF23]EXPOSE[-][/c] to your enemies.
